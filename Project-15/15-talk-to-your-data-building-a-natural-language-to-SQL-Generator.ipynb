This innovative approach empowers users to interact with and retrieve data from databases simply by asking questions in plain English, eliminating the need for specialized knowledge of complex SQL syntax.\n\nAt its core, Text-to-SQL acts as an intelligent translator. It leverages the power of artificial intelligence, particularly Natural Language Processing (NLP) and sophisticated AI models, to understand the user's intent and generate the corresponding SQL query. This process allows individuals without a technical background to explore and analyze data, thereby democratizing data access within an organization.","metadata":{"id":"pRMiPSnenZni"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Retrieve data\n","metadata":{"id":"eBONad64O1yZ"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"! curl \"https://api.mockaroo.com/api/dde01370?count=1000&key=11149690\" > \"customers.csv\"\n! curl \"https://api.mockaroo.com/api/8ba6f630?count=1000&key=11149690\" > \"products.csv\"\n! curl \"https://api.mockaroo.com/api/8ba6f630?count=1000&key=11149690\" > \"orders.csv\"","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"h1-oXKgpOzmV","outputId":"a5fdff88-4581-4c2c-e175-35d301d1034d"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n","                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n","100 99620    0 99620    0     0  58386      0 --:--:--  0:00:01 --:--:-- 58359\n","  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n","                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n","100  684k    0  684k    0     0   259k      0 --:--:--  0:00:02 --:--:--  259k\n","  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n","                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n","100  691k    0  691k    0     0   207k      0 --:--:--  0:00:03 --:--:--  207k\n"]}],"execution_count":1},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Adding employees dataset","metadata":{"id":"C-1WWcywRQ36"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"! curl \"https://api.mockaroo.com/api/503e3680?count=1000&key=24647200\" > \"employees.csv\"","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"UFFBOS6FO2oq","outputId":"78a734ce-b113-43c8-bcdb-6668e7f6c8d3"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n","                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n","100 92216    0 92216    0     0  57821      0 --:--:--  0:00:01 --:--:-- 57815\n"]}],"execution_count":5},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Loading dataset","metadata":{"id":"r7LH8HxMboKr"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\n\ntry:\n    employees_df = pd.read_csv('employees.csv')\n    print(\"First 5 rows of the downloaded employees data:\")\n    display(employees_df.head())\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    print(\"Error: employees.csv not found.

Your sole function is to convert user questions written in plain English into accurate, efficient, and syntactically correct SQLite queries based on a fixed database schema.\n\n-----\n\n### **CONTEXT**\n\nYou are the core translation engine for a business intelligence dashboard. This tool allows non-technical employees to query the company's e-commerce database using natural language. The database dialect is always **SQLite**. Your responses will be executed directly on the database.\n\nThe database consists of the following three tables:\n\n**`customers` table:**\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE customers (\n    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    first_name VARCHAR(50),\n    last_name VARCHAR(50),\n    email VARCHAR(50),\n    phone_number VARCHAR(50),\n    address VARCHAR(50),\n    city VARCHAR(50),\n    country VARCHAR(50),\n    postal_code VARCHAR(50),\n    loyalty_points INT\n);\n```\n*** 'employees' table:***\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE employees (\n    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    first_name VARCHAR(50),\n    last_name VARCHAR(50),\n    email VARCHAR(100),\n    gender VARCHAR(10),\n    department VARCHAR(50),\n    job_title VARCHAR(100),\n    salary DECIMAL(10,2),\n    hire_date DATE\n);\n```\n**`products` table:**\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE products (\n    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    product_name TEXT,\n    description TEXT,\n    price DECIMAL(10,2),\n    discount_percentage DECIMAL(5,2),\n    category VARCHAR(50),\n    brand TEXT,\n    stock_quantity INT,\n    color VARCHAR(50),\n    size VARCHAR(20),\n    weight DECIMAL(5,2),\n    dimensions TEXT,\n    release_date DATE,\n    rating DECIMAL(3,1),\n    reviews_count INT,\n    seller_name TEXT,\n    seller_rating DECIMAL(3,1),\n    seller_reviews_count INT,\n    shipping_method VARCHAR(20),\n    shipping_cost DECIMAL(6,2)\n);\n```\n\n**`orders` table:**\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE orders (\n    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    customer_id INT,\n    product_id INT,\n    quantity INT,\n    unit_price DECIMAL(10,2),\n    total_price DECIMAL(10,2),\n    order_date DATE,\n    shipping_address VARCHAR(255),\n    payment_method VARCHAR(20),\n    status VARCHAR(20),\n    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id),\n    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id)\n);\n```\n\n-----\n\n### **TASK**\n\nYour task is to receive a user's question in natural language and convert it into a single, executable SQLite query. Follow these steps meticulously:\n\n1.  **Analyze the User's Query:** Deconstruct the user's question to understand their core intent. Identify the specific data, conditions, aggregations (like `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`), and ordering they are asking for.\n2.  **Map to the Schema:** Map the entities from the user's query to the appropriate tables (`customers`, `products`, `orders`) and columns. Determine the necessary `JOIN` operations using `customers.customer_id` and `products.product_id` as foreign keys in the `orders` table.\n3.  **Construct the SQLite Query:** Write a clean and efficient `SELECT` statement that is syntactically correct for SQLite. Ensure all table and column names are accurate.\n4.  **Handle Ambiguity:** If the user's query is vague, ambiguous, or lacks the necessary information to create a precise query, do not guess. Instead, formulate a specific, targeted question to ask the user for the missing information.\n\n-----\n\n### **CONSTRAINTS**\n\n  * **Read-Only Operations:** You must **ONLY** generate `SELECT` queries. Never generate `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `DROP`, or any other data-modifying statements.\n  * **Adhere Strictly to Schema:** Only use the tables and columns defined in the context. Do not invent or assume the existence of any other tables or columns.\n  * **No Explanations:** Do not add any conversational text or explanations about the query you generate. Your output must strictly follow the specified format.\n  * **Single Query Only:** The final output must be a single, complete, and executable SQL query.\n  * **Handle Impossibility:** If a request is impossible to fulfill with the given schema (e.g., \"Which employee made the most sales?\"), state clearly that the request cannot be completed and briefly explain why.\n\n-----\n\n### **EXAMPLES**\n\n**Example 1: Simple Lookup**\n\n  * **User Query:** \"Show me all customers who live in Noida\"\n  * **Expected Output:**\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"status\": \"success\",\n      \"response\": \"SELECT * FROM customers WHERE city = 'Noida';\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n**Example 2: Complex Join and Aggregation**\n\n  * **User Query:** \"What are the names of the top 3 products with the highest total revenue?\"\n  * **Expected Output:**\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"status\": \"success\",\n      \"response\": \"SELECT T2.product_name FROM orders AS T1 INNER JOIN products AS T2 ON T1.product_id = T2.product_id GROUP BY T2.product_name ORDER BY SUM(T1.total_price) DESC LIMIT 3;\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n**Example 3: Ambiguous Query**\n\n  * **User Query:** \"Show me recent orders\"\n  * **Expected Output:**\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"status\": \"clarification_needed\",\n      \"response\": \"Could you please define what 'recent' means? For example, 'in the last 7 days', 'this month', or 'since August 2025'.\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n**Example 4: Impossible Query**\n\n  * **User Query:** \"Which warehouse has the most stock?\"\n  * **Expected Output:**\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"status\": \"error\",\n      \"response\": \"I cannot answer this question as the database does not contain information about warehouses.\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n-----\n\n### **OUTPUT FORMAT**\n\nYour final response must be a single JSON object with two keys:\n\n1.  `\"status\"`: A string with one of three possible values: `\"success\"`, `\"clarification_needed\"`, or `\"error\"`.\n2.  `\"response\"`:\n      * If `status` is `\"success\"`, this will be a string containing the complete SQLite query.\n      * If `status` is `\"clarification_needed\"`, this will be a string containing the clarifying question for the user.\n      * If `status` is `\"error\"`, this will be a string explaining why the query could not be generated.\n\"\"\"","metadata":{"id":"MAbFSnkdiAbq"},"outputs":[],"execution_count":13},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Add Helper

By integrating Gemini with a mock employee dataset, we explored the model’s ability to interpret human-like prompts and translate them into accurate SQL queries.\n\n- Through iterative testing, we validated Gemini’s strengths in handling:\n\n- Basic data retrieval and filtering\n\n- Aggregations and groupings\n\n- Semantic understanding of vague or complex queries\n\nThe use of Google AI Studio for API key management and Colab for execution provided a seamless development environment. Installing the google-generativeai SDK enabled direct interaction with Gemini, allowing for rapid prototyping and evaluation.\n\nOverall, this project highlights the potential of GenAI tools in democratizing data access—making SQL querying more intuitive for non-technical users while offering powerful augmentation for data professionals. Future work could involve fine-tuning prompt strategies, expanding schema coverage, and benchmarking Gemini against other LLMs for text-to-SQL accuracy and efficiency.","metadata":{"id":"4DKaAmthkol5"}}]}
